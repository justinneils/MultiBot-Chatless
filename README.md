## Important Notice

`MultiBot-Chatless` is the **addon-side repository only**.

To get the new bridge-first / mostly chatless behavior, you also need the server-side AzerothCore module:

<div align="center">

### 👉 <a href="https://github.com/Wishmaster117/mod-multibot-bridge">mod-multibot-bridge</a>

Without the bridge module, the addon cannot use the new structured `MBOT GET~...` data flow.

# What is MultiBot Chatless?

MultiBot is a user interface addon for the AzerothCore [`mod-playerbots`](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots) module.

This fork focuses on removing automatic bot chat spam from the main UI refresh paths by using a dedicated AzerothCore bridge module instead of relying on legacy chat parsing.

The addon now requests structured data from the server through `mod-multibot-bridge`.

Examples of bridge request families (arguments omitted here for readability):

```text
MBOT HELLO
MBOT PING
GET~ROSTER
GET~STATES
GET~WEAPON_ENCHANT
GET~DETAILS
GET~STATS
GET~PVP_STATS
GET~TALENT_SPEC_LIST
GET~INVENTORY
GET~BANK
GET~GBANK
GET~SPELLBOOK
GET~BOT_SKILLS
GET~BOT_REPUTATIONS
GET~BOT_EMBLEMS
GET~PROFESSION_RECIPES
GET~ENCHANT_TRADE
GET~GLYPHS
GET~OUTFITS
GET~QUESTS
GET~GAMEOBJECTS
GET~FORMATIONS
RUN~CRAFT_RECIPE
RUN~ITEM_ACTION
RUN~ITEM_EQUIP
RUN~ITEM_UNEQUIP
RUN~OUTFIT
RUN~RTI
RUN~COMBAT
RUN~POSITION
RUN~LOOT
RUN~STRATEGY
RUN~FORMATION
RUN~GROUP_ROLL
RUN~ENCHANT_TRADE
```

The Formation family uses the following complete party/raid-wide contracts:

```text
RUN~FORMATION~GROUP~~<token>~<formation>
FORMATION_ACK~GROUP~~<token>~<success>~<failure>~<formation>

GET~FORMATIONS~GROUP~~<token>
FORMATIONS_BEGIN~<token>~<count>
FORMATIONS_ITEM~<token>~<botName>~<formation>
FORMATIONS_END~<token>~<sentCount>
```

`GROUP` covers every controllable bot in the player's current party or raid. It does not target individual raid subgroups.

## Current state and strategy capabilities

The addon and bridge negotiate dedicated capabilities so newer write/read paths are used only when both sides support them:

```text
STATE_FRAMING_V1
STRATEGY_MUTATION_V1
OUTFIT_V1
INVENTORY_V1
INVENTORY_EXACT_V1
ITEM_MOVE_V1
ITEM_EQUIP_V1
ITEM_UNEQUIP_V1
ITEM_USE_V1
ITEM_SELL_SINGLE_V1
VENDOR_BUYBACK_V1
INVENTORY_BULK_SELL_V1
INVENTORY_OPEN_V1
GROUP_ROLL_V1
ENCHANT_TRADE_V1
```

`STATE_FRAMING_V1` uses tokenized `STATE` / `STATES` transactions with framed responses, bounded payloads, cleanup on terminal errors/timeouts, and stale-response protection. Per-bot requests use a 5-second timeout; global state requests use a 15-second timeout.

`STRATEGY_MUTATION_V1` provides structured `co/nc` mutations through `RUN~STRATEGY` and completion through `STRATEGY_ACK`. The bridge reports matched, succeeded and failed bot counts, while the addon applies explicit timeout and rejection diagnostics.

`INVENTORY_V1` provides the established native inventory read/refresh path. `INVENTORY_EXACT_V1` complements it with exact physical topology for Backpack, Bag 1..4 and Keyring, including empty slots and per-container filtering in the inventory UI. `ITEM_MOVE_V1` adds server-authoritative whole-stack drag/drop between allowed physical slots. The addon keeps only synthetic drag state: it does not call `PickupContainerItem`, `PickupInventoryItem`, `GetCursorInfo` or `ClearCursor`, and it does not mutate the displayed inventory optimistically; an exact snapshot refresh follows the server result. Stack splitting remains outside this capability. `ITEM_EQUIP_V1` equips an exact item from Backpack or Bag 1..4 through a structured bridge request and waits for the authoritative result before refreshing. `ITEM_UNEQUIP_V1` routes Inspect right-click through the exact equipment slot plus item ID, converts client Inspect slots 1..19 to Core slots 0..18, waits for the structured result and then refreshes. The historical `ue` whisper fallback is used only when `MultiBot.allowLegacyChatFallback == true`; normal bridge-first configuration keeps that fallback disabled. `ITEM_USE_V1` uses the exact physical source, waits for the structured `INVENTORY_ITEM_USE` result and delegates execution to the native use-item path. `ITEM_DESTROY` is a specialized exact-item destruction path with server-side source revalidation and an authoritative result. `ITEM_SELL_SINGLE_V1` validates the exact source and nearby vendor before native single-item sale and returns `INVENTORY_ITEM_SELL`. `VENDOR_BUYBACK_V1` exposes a structured Buyback list/result flow and uses the native Buyback handler before authoritative inventory/list refreshes. `INVENTORY_BULK_SELL_V1` and `INVENTORY_OPEN_V1` gate the current bulk-sell and `OPEN_ITEMS` bridge paths. `GROUP_ROLL_V1` gates the group Roll workflow; normal rolls and item-linked rolls are tokenized and completed through a structured `GROUP_ROLL_ACK`. `ENCHANT_TRADE_V1` gates the Enchanting Trade Service: the addon lists only known Enchanting spells exposed by the bot, uses the native WoW Trade window and the non-traded item slot, then requests one validated numeric spell ID through the bridge.

The migration is intentionally incremental. The Warlock stone, soulstone, pet and curse selectors are now migrated to structured `RUN~STRATEGY` mutations. When those selectors use the bridge, the addon waits for authoritative server `STATE` data before committing the selected UI state instead of applying an optimistic local state. Other specialized legacy UI paths still issue Playerbots chat commands directly and must be migrated before the addon can be described as fully chatless.

Manual playerbot commands are still intentionally preserved for diagnostics and gameplay actions.

Commands such as:

```text
who
co ?
nc ?
ss ?
```

still work when the player explicitly wants to inspect a bot state.

The goal is not to remove useful manual commands.  
The goal is to remove automatic UI-refresh spam.

The remaining legacy Playerbots Trade inventory dump is also suppressed locally by the addon. The filter recognizes the exact `=== Inventory ===` dump from known bots and hides that automatic dump for Inventory -> Trade, Enchanting -> Trade and the native WoW client Trade action, while leaving the Trade workflow itself unchanged.

### Warlock weapon-enchant diagnostic

For targeted runtime diagnostics, the addon exposes:

```text
/mbdebug enchant [bot]
```

If the bot name is omitted, the current target is used. The command sends a single `GET~WEAPON_ENCHANT` request and displays the structured `WEAPON_ENCHANT` response with main-hand/off-hand item entries, temporary enchant IDs and remaining durations. This path is diagnostic only: it is on-demand, server-authorized and rate-limited, and is not used for polling or normal selector state synchronization.

The endpoint and safe Firestone/Spellstone switching code are present, but the project-level final revalidation of the real `TEMP_ENCHANTMENT_SLOT` behavior is intentionally deferred until the end of the normal roadmap.

# Requirements

## Client

- World of Warcraft 3.3.5a / Wrath of the Lich King client.
- Tested with:
  - English / US client
  - German client
  - French client
  - Spanish client
- Localization files included for <code>enUS</code>, <code>enGB</code>, <code>frFR</code>, <code>esES</code>, <code>deDE</code>, <code>ruRU</code>, <code>zhCN</code> and <code>koKR</code>.

## Server

- [`AzerothCore WotLK`](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/azerothcore-wotlk/tree/Playerbot).
- [`mod-playerbots`](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots).
- [`mod-multibot-bridge`](https://github.com/Wishmaster117/mod-multibot-bridge).

---

# Installation

## 1. Install the server-side bridge module

Clone the bridge module inside your AzerothCore `modules` directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/azerothcore/modules
git clone https://github.com/Wishmaster117/mod-multibot-bridge.git mod-multibot-bridge
```

Expected structure:

```text
azerothcore/
└── modules/
    └── mod-multibot-bridge/
        ├── conf/
        └── src/
```

Then:

1. Re-run CMake if required by your build workflow.
2. Rebuild AzerothCore.
3. Copy/install the generated configuration file if required.
4. Start the server.
5. Check that `mod-multibot-bridge` is loaded.

When the addon connects successfully, the server console should show messages similar to:

```text
MBOT HELLO
MBOT HELLO_ACK
MBOT PING
MBOT PONG
GET~ROSTER
GET~STATES
GET~DETAILS
```

---

## 2. Install the client addon

Clone this repository into your World of Warcraft AddOns directory.

```bash
cd "World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns"
git clone https://github.com/Wishmaster117/MultiBot-Chatless.git MultiBot
```

Expected structure:

```text
World of Warcraft/
└── Interface/
    └── AddOns/
        └── MultiBot/
            ├── MultiBot.toc
            ├── Core/
            ├── Data/
            ├── Features/
            ├── Icons/
            ├── Libs/
            ├── Locales/
            ├── Strategies/
            ├── Textures/
            └── UI/
```

> The GitHub repository is named `MultiBot-Chatless`, but the local addon folder must be named `MultiBot`.

Do not install it like this:

```text
Interface/AddOns/MultiBot/MultiBot/MultiBot.toc
```

The `.toc` file must be directly here:

```text
Interface/AddOns/MultiBot/MultiBot.toc
```

---

# Updating

## Update the addon

```bash
cd "World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/MultiBot"
git pull
```

## Update the bridge module

```bash
cd /path/to/azerothcore/modules/mod-multibot-bridge
git pull
```

Then rebuild your AzerothCore server if the module code changed.

---

# Recommended Configuration

For normal bridge-first usage, keep legacy automatic chat fallback disabled:

```lua
MultiBot.allowLegacyChatFallback = false
```

Only enable it temporarily for debugging or compatibility testing:

```lua
MultiBot.allowLegacyChatFallback = true
```

---

# Usage

Start World of Warcraft and use one of the following commands:

```text
/multibot
/mbot
/mb
```

You can also use the minimap button.

When the bridge is available, the addon automatically uses structured bridge messages for the main UI refresh paths instead of legacy chat replies.

Manual commands are still available when you intentionally want them.

Examples:

```text
/w BotName who
/w BotName co ?
/w BotName nc ?
/w BotName ss ?
```

# Current Status

Implemented bridge-first / chatless areas:

- Bridge handshake: `HELLO`, `HELLO_ACK`, `PING`, `PONG`.
- Roster refresh.
- Bot states through `STATE_FRAMING_V1`, with tokenized per-bot/global transactions, framed responses, bounded state payloads, timeout cleanup and stale-response protection.
- Strategy mutations through `STRATEGY_MUTATION_V1` for migrated controls, with `RUN~STRATEGY`, `STRATEGY_ACK`, result counters and explicit rejection/timeout diagnostics.
- Bot details refresh.
- Stats refresh.
- PvP stats refresh.
- Talent spec list refresh.
- Inventory read/refresh through `INVENTORY_V1`, complemented by `INVENTORY_EXACT_V1` for bag-aware physical topology across Backpack, Bag 1..4 and Keyring, including empty slots and per-container filters.
- Whole-stack inventory drag/drop through `ITEM_MOVE_V1`, with synthetic addon drag state, no native player cursor APIs, no optimistic inventory mutation and an exact snapshot refresh after the structured server result. Stack splitting remains out of scope.
- Exact inventory equip through `ITEM_EQUIP_V1`, with source identity revalidation, authoritative result handling and no optimistic UI mutation.
- Exact Inspect unequip through `ITEM_UNEQUIP_V1`, with exact equipment slot/item identity and legacy `ue` fallback disabled unless explicitly enabled.
- Exact item use through `ITEM_USE_V1`, with native use-item execution, source revalidation, structured result handling and localized failure reasons.
- Exact item destruction through the specialized `ITEM_DESTROY` path with server-side source revalidation.
- Exact single-item vendor sale through `ITEM_SELL_SINGLE_V1`, with nearby-vendor validation, protected-item guards, replay/rate limiting and structured result handling.
- Vendor Buyback through `VENDOR_BUYBACK_V1`, with structured list/result messages, native Buyback execution and authoritative inventory/list refreshes.
- Bulk inventory sell through `INVENTORY_BULK_SELL_V1` when supported; `SELL_VENDOR` is bridge-first in normal current operation, while legacy compatibility fallback remains available and SELL_GREY follow-up is deferred.
- `OPEN_ITEMS` through `INVENTORY_OPEN_V1`, with structured result handling and no silent chat fallback in the normal bridge-first path.
- Group Roll through `GROUP_ROLL_V1`: normal 0–100 roll and Shift+click item roll, tokenized pending state, duplicate-send protection, timeout/cleanup handling and structured `GROUP_ROLL_ACK`.
- Spellbook refresh, with profession/crafting spells separated from the combat spellbook path.
- Character Info frame through the bridge with Blizzard-style tabs for class, profession, secondary, weapon and armor skills, reputations and currencies/emblems.
- Bot bank and guild bank snapshots through the bridge, plus bank deposit/withdraw, guild bank deposit/withdraw and vendor buy item actions.
- Profession recipe frame through the bridge, opened from profession and secondary skill rows.
- Enchanting Trade Service through `ENCHANT_TRADE_V1`: dedicated enchanter-only UI from EveryBar/Character Info, known-spell listing, reagent/tool availability, native `TRADE_SLOT_NONTRADED` targeting and validated numeric spell execution without generic Playerbots command/chat dispatch.
- Glyph refresh with icons and glyph tooltips.
- Outfits refresh and actions through the bridge.
- Outfit equip/replace without detailed `Equipping [item] ...` chat spam.
- Quest list refresh through the bridge.
- Game object search results and copy frame through the bridge.
- RTI controls through the bridge.
- Pull Control frame through the bridge.
- Combat strategy fine tuning through the bridge.
- Disperse controls through the bridge with `disperse set <yards>` and `disperse disable`.
- Party/raid-wide formation application through `RUN~FORMATION`, with per-bot effective formation inspection through `GET~FORMATIONS` and no PARTY/RAID chat output.
- Localized formation status tooltip for all eight addon locale files.
- Loot rules through the bridge with `nc +loot`, `nc -loot` and `ll all|normal|gray|quest|skill`.
- Loot Master UI for master-loot distribution with item tooltips, candidate scoring, profession/spec hints, saved preferences and recent loot history.
- Bridge-visible bot discovery for AddClass bots, altbots and grouped randombots.
- Custom glyph socket mapping and apply order.
- Talent tab navigation stability after switching between tabs.
- Automatic bot reconnect on login/reload for bots already present in the group or raid.
- Units bar refresh after adding a bot through AddClass.

Validated development milestones on the current line:

- PR #49 — bridge synchronization, strategy controls, persistent/offline favorites and STATE stabilization.
- PR #50 — explicit strategy-command rejection diagnostics.
- PR #51 — mechanical deduplication of shared roster workflow helpers.
- PR #53 — prevent silent chat fallback for strategy mutations.
- PR #54 — outfit actions migrated to the negotiated bridge capability.
- PR #55 — strict bridge routing for inventory read/refresh.
- PR #58 — single-bot inventory Sell Vendor migrated to the bridge.
- PR #60 — bridge-first `OPEN_ITEMS`.
- PR #61 — chatless Group Roll UI, merged as `106074c3c93f80812f73af27e746860c7c8a4dcf`.
- Final static STATE/strategy audit on 2026-08-07: 57 checks, 0 failures; final manual runtime matrix remains pending.
- Warlock selector batch is migrated to bridge strategy mutations; final project-level real TEMP_ENCHANT revalidation and the four remaining LuaLint warnings are explicitly deferred.
- Group Roll runtime validation on 2026-08-14: normal roll, item roll, eligibility, no chat spam, duplicate protection, invalid/empty item rejection and pending cleanup all validated.
- Enchanting Trade Service runtime validation on 2026-08-14: enchanter-only button, list/search/tooltips, localized 440 px frame, normal WoW Trade flow and real item enchant application all validated with no automatic chat executor.

Known migration remaining:

- Remaining direct `SendChatMessage` occurrences outside migrated paths still need to be classified as manual command, diagnostic fallback, information message, UI mechanism to migrate, compatibility fallback, or dead code.
- Item enchanting is now **implemented and runtime validated** through the closed `ENCHANT_TRADE_V1` Trade Service; it does not expose a generic cast or arbitrary Playerbots command executor.
- The next normal roadmap item is **item-specific loot-rule add/remove**, followed by the Quest/Skill versus Disenchant decision and collective `follow` / `attack` / `stay` orders.
- The project should be described as **bridge-first / mostly chatless**, not fully chatless, until these remaining paths are classified/migrated and the final runtime matrix is closed.

Kept intentionally:

- Manual whisper/playerbot commands for diagnostics.
- Commands such as `who`, `co ?`, `nc ?`, `ss ?`.
- Gameplay write actions that still rely on existing playerbot commands.
- Optional legacy fallback behavior only for debugging or compatibility.

# Remaining Work

The current line includes bridge-first inventory refresh, exact bag-aware inventory topology, native whole-stack item drag/drop, outfits, Sell Vendor, `OPEN_ITEMS`, Group Roll and the runtime-validated Enchanting Trade Service in addition to the previously migrated UI areas. The roadmap is intentionally continuing feature-family by feature-family rather than jumping directly to final cleanup.

Next normal roadmap work:

1. Audit and implement item-specific loot-rule add/remove using verified Playerbots interfaces only.
2. Decide the Quest/Skill versus Disenchant path from verified Playerbots capabilities.
3. Audit collective `follow`, `attack` and `stay` selectors before any structured group-order migration.

Explicitly deferred until the normal roadmap is complete:

- SELL_GREY / sell-grey core API / bridge-first follow-up.
- Final real Firestone/Spellstone `TEMP_ENCHANTMENT_SLOT` revalidation.
- Four remaining LuaLint warnings in `Strategies/MultiBotWarlock.lua`.
- Other small items that were explicitly deferred during previous validated batches.

Ongoing finalization work remains unchanged: regression testing, classification of residual `SendChatMessage` paths, removal of dead legacy parsers only after proof of non-regression, and documentation/screenshot cleanup after wider testing.

# Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>The addon does not load</strong></summary>

Check that the folder is named exactly:

```text
Interface/AddOns/MultiBot
```

and that the `.toc` file is here:

```text
Interface/AddOns/MultiBot/MultiBot.toc
```

If the `.toc` file is inside another nested `MultiBot` folder, the addon is installed incorrectly.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The addon loads but the bridge does not connect</strong></summary>

Check that:

- `mod-multibot-bridge` is installed in the AzerothCore `modules` directory.
- AzerothCore was rebuilt after installing the module.
- The server was restarted after rebuilding.
- The bridge module is visible in server logs.
- Your client is logged into a character connected to the server.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I still see some chat messages</strong></summary>

This project removes automatic UI-refresh spam where the bridge path has been implemented.

Manual commands and gameplay actions may still produce intentional messages.

Make sure this value is disabled unless you are debugging:

```lua
MultiBot.allowLegacyChatFallback = false
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The formation tooltip does not appear or is incomplete</strong></summary>

Check that the bridge is connected and that the bots are controllable members of the same party or raid as the player.

A right-click on the Formation button should produce structured bridge traffic similar to:

```text
GET~FORMATIONS~GROUP~~<token>
FORMATIONS_BEGIN~<token>~<count>
FORMATIONS_ITEM~<token>~<botName>~<formation>
FORMATIONS_END~<token>~<sentCount>
```

The query is raid-wide: it includes all controllable bots in the current party or raid and does not target individual raid subgroups.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Inventory, spellbook, glyphs or outfits do not update</strong></summary>

Check the server console for bridge requests such as:

```text
GET~INVENTORY
GET~BANK
GET~GBANK
GET~SPELLBOOK
GET~GLYPHS
GET~OUTFITS
GET~BOT_SKILLS
GET~BOT_REPUTATIONS
GET~BOT_EMBLEMS
GET~PROFESSION_RECIPES
GET~QUESTS
GET~GAMEOBJECTS
```

If these requests do not appear, the addon may not be connected to the bridge.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The Loot Master frame does not open</strong></summary>

Check that:

- The Loot Master UI option is enabled in the addon options.
- The group loot method is set to Master Loot.
- Your character is the detected master looter.
- The opened loot contains relevant loot slots.

The frame uses the client master-loot candidate API and enriches candidates with cached bridge details when available.
