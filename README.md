## Important Notice

`MultiBot-Chatless` is the **addon-side repository only**.

To get the new bridge-first / mostly chatless behavior, you also need the server-side AzerothCore module:

<div align="center">

### 👉 <a href="https://github.com/Wishmaster117/mod-multibot-bridge">mod-multibot-bridge</a>

</div>

Without the bridge module, the addon cannot use the new structured `MBOT GET~...` data flow.

# What is MultiBot Chatless?

MultiBot is a user interface addon for the AzerothCore [`mod-playerbots`](https://github.com/mod-playerbots/mod-playerbots) module.

This fork focuses on removing automatic bot chat spam from the main UI refresh paths by using a dedicated AzerothCore bridge module instead of relying on legacy chat parsing.

The addon now requests structured data from the server through `mod-multibot-bridge`.

Examples of bridge request families (arguments omitted here for readability):

```text
MBOT HELLO
MBOT PING
GET~ROSTER
GET~STATES
GET~WEAPON_ENCHANT
GET~DETAILS
GET~STATS
GET~PVP_STATS
GET~TALENT_SPEC_LIST
GET~INVENTORY
GET~BANK
GET~GBANK
GET~SPELLBOOK
GET~BOT_SKILLS
GET~BOT_REPUTATIONS
GET~BOT_EMBLEMS
GET~PROFESSION_RECIPES
GET~GLYPHS
GET~OUTFITS
GET~QUESTS
GET~GAMEOBJECTS
GET~FORMATIONS
RUN~CRAFT_RECIPE
RUN~ITEM_ACTION
RUN~OUTFIT
RUN~RTI
RUN~COMBAT
RUN~POSITION
RUN~LOOT
RUN~STRATEGY
RUN~FORMATION
```

The Formation family uses the following complete party/raid-wide contracts:

```text
RUN~FORMATION~GROUP~~<token>~<formation>
FORMATION_ACK~GROUP~~<token>~<success>~<failure>~<formation>

GET~FORMATIONS~GROUP~~<token>
FORMATIONS_BEGIN~<token>~<count>
FORMATIONS_ITEM~<token>~<botName>~<formation>
FORMATIONS_END~<token>~<sentCount>
```

`GROUP` covers every controllable bot in the player's current party or raid. It does not target individual raid subgroups.

## Current state and strategy capabilities

The addon and bridge now negotiate two dedicated capabilities for authoritative bot-state synchronization and strategy mutations:

```text
STATE_FRAMING_V1
STRATEGY_MUTATION_V1
```

`STATE_FRAMING_V1` uses tokenized `STATE` / `STATES` transactions with framed responses, bounded payloads, cleanup on terminal errors/timeouts, and stale-response protection. Per-bot requests use a 5-second timeout; global state requests use a 15-second timeout.

`STRATEGY_MUTATION_V1` provides structured `co/nc` mutations through `RUN~STRATEGY` and completion through `STRATEGY_ACK`. The bridge reports matched, succeeded and failed bot counts, while the addon applies explicit timeout and rejection diagnostics.

The migration is intentionally incremental. The Warlock stone, soulstone, pet and curse selectors are now migrated to structured `RUN~STRATEGY` mutations. When those selectors use the bridge, the addon waits for authoritative server `STATE` data before committing the selected UI state instead of applying an optimistic local state. Other specialized legacy UI paths still issue Playerbots chat commands directly and must be migrated before the addon can be described as fully chatless.

Manual playerbot commands are still intentionally preserved for diagnostics and gameplay actions.

Commands such as:

```text
who
co ?
nc ?
ss ?
```

still work when the player explicitly wants to inspect a bot state.

The goal is not to remove useful manual commands.  
The goal is to remove automatic UI-refresh spam.

### Warlock weapon-enchant diagnostic

For targeted runtime diagnostics, the addon exposes:

```text
/mbdebug enchant [bot]
```

If the bot name is omitted, the current target is used. The command sends a single `GET~WEAPON_ENCHANT` request and displays the structured `WEAPON_ENCHANT` response with main-hand/off-hand item entries, temporary enchant IDs and remaining durations. This path is diagnostic only: it is on-demand, server-authorized and rate-limited, and is not used for polling or normal selector state synchronization.

---

# Installation

## 1. Install the server-side bridge module

Clone the bridge module inside your AzerothCore `modules` directory:

```bash
cd /path/to/azerothcore/modules
git clone https://github.com/Wishmaster117/mod-multibot-bridge.git mod-multibot-bridge
```

Expected structure:

```text
azerothcore/
└── modules/
    └── mod-multibot-bridge/
        ├── conf/
        └── src/
```

Then:

1. Re-run CMake if required by your build workflow.
2. Rebuild AzerothCore.
3. Copy/install the generated configuration file if required.
4. Start the server.
5. Check that `mod-multibot-bridge` is loaded.

When the addon connects successfully, the server console should show messages similar to:

```text
MBOT HELLO
MBOT HELLO_ACK
MBOT PING
MBOT PONG
GET~ROSTER
GET~STATES
GET~DETAILS
```

---

## 2. Install the client addon

Clone this repository into your World of Warcraft AddOns directory.

```bash
cd "World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns"
git clone https://github.com/Wishmaster117/MultiBot-Chatless.git MultiBot
```

Expected structure:

```text
World of Warcraft/
└── Interface/
    └── AddOns/
        └── MultiBot/
            ├── MultiBot.toc
            ├── Core/
            ├── Data/
            ├── Features/
            ├── Icons/
            ├── Libs/
            ├── Locales/
            ├── Strategies/
            ├── Textures/
            └── UI/
```

> The GitHub repository is named `MultiBot-Chatless`, but the local addon folder must be named `MultiBot`.

Do not install it like this:

```text
Interface/AddOns/MultiBot/MultiBot/MultiBot.toc
```

The `.toc` file must be directly here:

```text
Interface/AddOns/MultiBot/MultiBot.toc
```

---

# Updating

## Update the addon

```bash
cd "World of Warcraft/Interface/AddOns/MultiBot"
git pull
```

## Update the bridge module

```bash
cd /path/to/azerothcore/modules/mod-multibot-bridge
git pull
```

Then rebuild your AzerothCore server if the module code changed.

---

# Recommended Configuration

For normal bridge-first usage, keep legacy automatic chat fallback disabled:

```lua
MultiBot.allowLegacyChatFallback = false
```

Only enable it temporarily for debugging or compatibility testing:

```lua
MultiBot.allowLegacyChatFallback = true
```

---

# Usage

Start World of Warcraft and use one of the following commands:

```text
/multibot
/mbot
/mb
```

You can also use the minimap button.

When the bridge is available, the addon automatically uses structured bridge messages for the main UI refresh paths instead of legacy chat replies.

Manual commands are still available when you intentionally want them.

Examples:

```text
/w BotName who
/w BotName co ?
/w BotName nc ?
/w BotName ss ?
```

# Current Status

Implemented bridge-first / chatless areas:

- Bridge handshake: `HELLO`, `HELLO_ACK`, `PING`, `PONG`.
- Roster refresh.
- Bot states through `STATE_FRAMING_V1`, with tokenized per-bot/global transactions, framed responses, bounded state payloads, timeout cleanup and stale-response protection.
- Strategy mutations through `STRATEGY_MUTATION_V1` for migrated controls, with `RUN~STRATEGY`, `STRATEGY_ACK`, result counters and explicit rejection/timeout diagnostics.
- Bot details refresh.
- Stats refresh.
- PvP stats refresh.
- Talent spec list refresh.
- Inventory refresh with icons and item tooltips.
- Spellbook refresh, with profession/crafting spells separated from the combat spellbook path.
- Character Info frame through the bridge with Blizzard-style tabs for class, profession, secondary, weapon and armor skills, reputations and currencies/emblems.
- Bot bank and guild bank snapshots through the bridge, plus bank deposit/withdraw, guild bank deposit/withdraw and vendor buy item actions.
- Profession recipe frame through the bridge, opened from profession and secondary skill rows.
- Glyph refresh with icons and glyph tooltips.
- Outfits refresh and actions through the bridge.
- Outfit equip/replace without detailed `Equipping [item] ...` chat spam.
- Quest list refresh through the bridge.
- Game object search results and copy frame through the bridge.
- RTI controls through the bridge.
- Pull Control frame through the bridge.
- Combat strategy fine tuning through the bridge.
- Disperse controls through the bridge with `disperse set <yards>` and `disperse disable`.
- Party/raid-wide formation application through `RUN~FORMATION`, with per-bot effective formation inspection through `GET~FORMATIONS` and no PARTY/RAID chat output.
- Localized formation status tooltip for all eight addon locale files.
- Loot rules through the bridge with `nc +loot`, `nc -loot` and `ll all|normal|gray|quest|skill`.
- Loot Master UI for master-loot distribution with item tooltips, candidate scoring, profession/spec hints, saved preferences and recent loot history.
- Bridge-visible bot discovery for AddClass bots, altbots and grouped randombots.
- Custom glyph socket mapping and apply order.
- Talent tab navigation stability after switching between tabs.
- Automatic bot reconnect on login/reload for bots already present in the group or raid.
- Units bar refresh after adding a bot through AddClass.

Validated development milestones on the current line:

- PR #49 — bridge synchronization, strategy controls, persistent/offline favorites and STATE stabilization.
- PR #50 — explicit strategy-command rejection diagnostics.
- PR #51 — mechanical deduplication of shared roster workflow helpers.
- Final static STATE/strategy audit on 2026-08-07: 57 checks, 0 failures; final manual runtime matrix remains pending.
- Warlock selector batch validated on 2026-08-08: Stones, Soulstones, Pets and Curses migrated to bridge strategy mutations; authoritative bridge state handling validated; Firestone/Spellstone temporary-enchant switching validated bidirectionally with the companion bridge.

Known migration remaining:

- Remaining direct `SendChatMessage` occurrences outside the validated Warlock selector batch still need to be classified as manual command, diagnostic fallback, information message, UI mechanism to migrate, or dead code.
- The project should be described as **bridge-first / mostly chatless**, not fully chatless, until these remaining paths are classified/migrated and the final runtime matrix is closed.

Kept intentionally:

- Manual whisper/playerbot commands for diagnostics.
- Commands such as `who`, `co ?`, `nc ?`, `ss ?`.
- Gameplay write actions that still rely on existing playerbot commands.
- Optional legacy fallback behavior only for debugging or compatibility.

---

# Remaining Work

The Outfits, RTI, Pull Control, Combat Strategy, Disperse, Loot Rules, Quest, Game Object, Character Info, Profession Recipe, Reputations, Currencies and advanced inventory bank/vendor migrations are implemented. The Loot Master UI is also implemented as an optional client-side master-loot helper. The next step is final stabilization and cleanup.

Planned follow-up work:

- Regression test login, `/reload`, large raid groups, Units, EveryBars, Stats, PvP Stats, Inventory, Bot Bank, Guild Bank, Vendor Buy, Spellbook, Character Info, Reputations, Currencies, Profession Recipes, Talents, Glyphs, Outfits, Quests, Game Objects, RTI, Pull Control, Combat Strategies, Disperse, Loot Rules and Loot Master.
- Verify that `MultiBot.allowLegacyChatFallback = false` prevents automatic legacy refresh spam on all migrated UI paths.
- Keep manual diagnostic commands documented and functional.
- Remove obsolete debug prints.
- Remove dead legacy parser paths once bridge-first behavior is fully stable.
- Update screenshots and user documentation after wider testing.

# Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary><strong>The addon does not load</strong></summary>

Check that the folder is named exactly:

```text
Interface/AddOns/MultiBot
```

and that the `.toc` file is here:

```text
Interface/AddOns/MultiBot/MultiBot.toc
```

If the `.toc` file is inside another nested `MultiBot` folder, the addon is installed incorrectly.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The addon loads but the bridge does not connect</strong></summary>

Check that:

- `mod-multibot-bridge` is installed in the AzerothCore `modules` directory.
- AzerothCore was rebuilt after installing the module.
- The server was restarted after rebuilding.
- The bridge module is visible in server logs.
- Your client is logged into a character connected to the server.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I still see some chat messages</strong></summary>

This project removes automatic UI-refresh spam where the bridge path has been implemented.

Manual commands and gameplay actions may still produce intentional messages.

Make sure this value is disabled unless you are debugging:

```lua
MultiBot.allowLegacyChatFallback = false
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The formation tooltip does not appear or is incomplete</strong></summary>

Check that the bridge is connected and that the bots are controllable members of the same party or raid as the player.

A right-click on the Formation button should produce structured bridge traffic similar to:

```text
GET~FORMATIONS~GROUP~~<token>
FORMATIONS_BEGIN~<token>~<count>
FORMATIONS_ITEM~<token>~<botName>~<formation>
FORMATIONS_END~<token>~<sentCount>
```

The query is raid-wide: it includes all controllable bots in the current party or raid and does not target individual raid subgroups.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Inventory, spellbook, glyphs or outfits do not update</strong></summary>

Check the server console for bridge requests such as:

```text
GET~INVENTORY
GET~BANK
GET~GBANK
GET~SPELLBOOK
GET~GLYPHS
GET~OUTFITS
GET~BOT_SKILLS
GET~BOT_REPUTATIONS
GET~BOT_EMBLEMS
GET~PROFESSION_RECIPES
GET~QUESTS
GET~GAMEOBJECTS
```

If these requests do not appear, the addon may not be connected to the bridge.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>The Loot Master frame does not open</strong></summary>

Check that:

- The Loot Master UI option is enabled in the addon options.
- The group loot method is set to Master Loot.
- Your character is the detected master looter.
- The opened loot contains relevant loot slots.

The frame uses the client master-loot candidate API and enriches candidates with cached bridge details when available.
